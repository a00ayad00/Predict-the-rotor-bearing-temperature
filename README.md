# Predict-the-rotor-bearing-temperature

Unplanned downtime of wind turbines can result in a significant loss of revenue and energy and can easily scale to millions of dollars a year. It is therefore pivotal that flagging the failure of components is made to prevent further loss and perform maintenance. It, however, involves the replacement of components and higher costs.
Condition-based monitoring systems rely on supervisory control and data acquisition systems to predict faults and get valuable insights into the turbine’s performance.

In this competition, We have normalized data of wind speed, power, and temperature data for multiple components of a wind turbine. We are looking to create a model to get an ideally functioning turbine’s expected rotor bearing temperature. The model will then be used to check the deviation of the actual rotor bearing temperature of the faulty turbine from the expected temperature.
